  - variation_name: One-color seal
    variation_description: >-

usage: >-
  ## Use cases


  The seal should never be used on consumer-facing materials, as it is important
  that the CFPB logo is consistently used to help consumers recognize and trust
  the CFPB. The seal should be used only on materials regarding enforcement,
  governmental affairs and official items from the Director’s office:


  * Official correspondence from the Director

  * Event materials where the Director’s office is the primary participant
  (e.g., podium placards and signage)

  * Statutorily required reports

  * Examiner commissioning certificates

  * Legal actions

  * Office of Administrative Adjudication official documents

  * PIV cards

  * Bureau flag

  * Employee awards, commendations, and certificates from the Director

  * Delegations of Authority from the Director

  ## Sizing


  Use the seal at its benchmark size of 1.75" for most materials, such as a
  report cover. For materials such as signage and flags where the seal needs to
  appear larger, increase the seal's size in increments of 0.5".

  ## Placement


  #### Clearspace


  Use ample space around the seal to ensure maximum impact and keep the mark
  from looking cluttered. The clear space on each side of the seal should be
  1/4" of the seal's size. 


  #### Background color


  Place the seal on a white background. The only other color the seal may be
  placed on is navy, and this is reserved for select cases, such as the CFPB's
  flag.
